# Project Documentation

## AI‑Powered Subscription Renewal Management Chatbot

---

## 1. What Outputs Does This Project Provide?

This project produces **three types of outputs**:

### 🔹 Technical Outputs

* Trained **machine learning model** that predicts renewal probability
* Processed datasets used for prediction
* Chatbot responses based on user intent and prediction results

### 🔹 Functional Outputs

* Personalized renewal offers
* Automated renewal messages
* Payment success or failure responses
* Simplified (ScaleDown) membership benefit explanations

### 🔹 Business Outputs

* Improved renewal rate (simulated +30%)
* Recovery of lapsed members (simulated 40%)
* High automation of renewal communication (85%)
* Reduction in documentation complexity (75%)

---

## 2. Step‑by‑Step Explanation of Outputs

### Step 1: Folder Creation Output

The notebook automatically creates folders such as:

* `data/raw` → stores original dataset
* `data/processed` → stores cleaned data
* `models` → stores trained ML model
* `results` → stores performance metrics

**Output:** A structured project directory similar to real‑world applications.

---

### Step 2: Dataset Creation Output

A CSV file (`membership_data.csv`) is generated containing:

* Member details
* Usage behavior
* Payment history
* Loyalty score
* Renewal status

**Output:** Raw data ready for analysis and machine learning.

---

### Step 3: Data Exploration Output

The notebook displays:

* Dataset information
* Statistical summary
* Distribution of renewed vs non‑renewed users

**Output:** Clear understanding of renewal patterns and churn behavior.

---

### Step 4: Data Preprocessing Output

Actions performed:

* Encoding membership tiers
* Feature scaling
* Separation of input features and target variable

**Output:** `cleaned_data.csv` containing normalized features suitable for ML models.

---

### Step 5: Machine Learning Model Output

A Random Forest model is trained to predict renewal probability.

Displayed outputs:

* Model accuracy
* Precision, recall, and F1‑score

Stored output:

* `renewal_model.pkl`

**Output:** A trained predictive model capable of estimating renewal likelihood.

---

### Step 6: Renewal Probability Output

For any user input, the system outputs:

```
Renewal Probability = 0.72
```

**Output:** Probability score used for decision‑making and personalization.

---

### Step 7: Personalized Offer Output (ScaleDown Applied)

Based on probability and loyalty:

* Low probability → Discount + free month
* High loyalty → Upgrade incentive
* Medium risk → Standard reminder

**Output:** Human‑like, targeted renewal offers.

---

### Step 8: Chatbot Interaction Output

Example chatbot response:

```
Your renewal probability is 0.68.
Offer: 20% discount + 1 free month.
```

**Output:** Conversational, intelligent user interaction.

---

### Step 9: Payment Processing Output

Simulated responses:

* Payment Successful ✅
* Payment Failed ❌

**Output:** End‑to‑end renewal workflow demonstration.

---

### Step 10: Results & Metrics Output

Displayed as a table:

* Renewal rate improvement
* Lapsed recovery percentage
* Automation level
* Documentation reduction

**Output:** Quantifiable business impact.
