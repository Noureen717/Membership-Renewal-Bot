# AI-Powered Subscription Renewal Management Chatbot

## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on developing an **AI-powered renewal management chatbot** for subscription-based platforms such as SaaS, EdTech, OTT, and membership services. The system automates the renewal lifecycle by predicting renewal behavior, simplifying membership benefits using a ScaleDown approach, and delivering personalized renewal offers through a conversational interface.

The chatbot reduces churn, recovers lapsed members, and improves customer engagement while minimizing manual operational effort.
